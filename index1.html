        <div class="Book_author">
            By: Erin Hunter
        </div>
            <p>The Warriors universe centres around a large group of feral cats who initially reside in a forest, and later, around a lake after fleeing their initial home due to its destruction by humans. The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the moors, RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps.</p>
        <div class="Book_title">
            <li>Too Close To Home</li>
        </div>
        <div class="Book_author">
            By: Linwood Barclay
        </div>
            <p>Linwood Barclay, critically acclaimed author of No Time for Goodbye, brings terror closer than ever before in a thriller where murder strikes in the place we feel safest of all. Promise Falls isn't the kind of community where a family is shot to death in their own home. But that is exactly what happened to the Langleys one sweltering summer night, and no one in this small upstate New York town is more shocked than their next-door neighbors, Jim and Ellen Cutter.</p>
